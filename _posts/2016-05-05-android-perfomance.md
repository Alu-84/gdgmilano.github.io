### Abstract

Performance is just as essential to native apps as it is to web applications, but it is only recently that developers have begun to seriously look into the performance issues in their native applications. In this presentation, Doug Sillars will do a demo of some performance tools for native applications, and discuss how we might integrate them into our workflow.
Alongside the talk there will be a dive into a couple of great tools out there that can help developers find perf issues: 

- Leak Canary for memory leaks
- ARO for network Performance 

If time (and interest) permits, we can also look at Systrace or other tools for CPU performance.
